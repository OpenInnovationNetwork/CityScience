The idea for the first project is to use Yelp ratings based on the approach used by Chang (resulting in weighted ratings score unique to the individual city) and to compare the score of a 3 for Chinese food in one city with the score in another city because some cities will be tougher or easier raters.  

We will do this in a way that is reproducible based on the data science method followed at law.MIT.edu here:
